#General Description
a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe made with Javascript, HTML, CSS and the library jQuery that allows replayability and scoring as well as input of player name

#Progress
Steady progress from start to finish of the main product which is the game and the small additional features. Began initially with the hard coded copy for every condition of win and every condition of a click on a square that was heavily reduced later on. Attempt for a Minimax algorithm to play the game was made and can be found in the commit list though unfinished. Found difficulties with looping through each possible branch after the initial and when it worked it had always returned a loss for unknown reasons. Unable to finish the Minimax algorithm for now but will return.
